## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flex-box


### What I learned

I learned to combine the use of `width`, `max-width` and `min-width`... it can be a useful way to define responsive behaviors, without adding code in `@media`.
